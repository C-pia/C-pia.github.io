Magazine</span></p><br><h1 class="c9" id="h.8ikwrvmef2ph"><span class="c34 c34">Hello, World</span></h1><br><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">A man once said: what is posted to the internet can never be erased.<br>Man is often known to be wrong. That only becomes more clear the more famous a subject becomes.<br>Case in point - Maeda Jun. A man of much mystery, much misinformation, much miscommunication, and yet... a man who is very open.<br>With the passing of years, information large and small has been lost to time, or trapped behind a language barrier no one has bothered to breach. Some things were forgotten as fans became old and others became new, and other things never spread beyond a scrap of paper in a disc that sold mere thousands.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1"><br>With old web pages dying and search engines growing worse, the primary sources are no longer easily accessible. So before they go, let this be a reference to them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">In digging up old interviews and magazine articles, looking into radio shows and audio commentaries, reading diary entries dating all the way back to 1998, sharing uncited memories of interviews and events, looking at fan and critic reception over the years, spoiling a bunch of Key games, and highlighting often overlooked works, I hope to shine some light on one of the industry&#39;s most influential creators.</span></p><p class="c4 c18"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">This article isn&#39;t about the events of big, popular games or anime that everyone aware of has already seen; this is about a person, and all he&#39;ll leave behind.</span></p><br><h1 class="c9" id="h.1691v9ofle4d"><span class="c34 c34">Ordinary Days</span></h1><br><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Inspired by Murakami Haruki&#39;s </span><span class="c11 c1">Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</span><span class="c3 c1">, Maeda&#39;s quirk as a writer was his focus on a psychological look at relationships, paired with an anti-utopian message that a happy, imperfect life is a greater ideal than one of endless satisfaction.<br>Along with this, Leaf&#39;s earlier works and various albums became Maeda&#39;s main source of pre-Tactics industry inspiration, though for his own personal tastes, fantasy and sci-fi RPGs as well as children&#39;s anime about cute young girls were his usual choices.</span></p><p class="c4 c18"><span class="c3 c1"></span><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Music was always his best friend when it came to writing. He found it nearly impossible to work without having music to listen to.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The song </span><span class="c11 c1">Flaming June</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;by BT was a big inspiration during his days working at Tactics. Many other songs have inspired him due to his habit of listening to music while doing work - other than when he&#39;s composing, of course.<br>It wasn&#39;t until the development of </span><span class="c11 c1">MOON.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that Maeda learned how to compose music using a computer, taught to him by the team&#39;s two musicians. The software he grew familiar with, </span><span class="c11 c1">Recomposer</span><span class="c1">, remains the main program in his music-making toolset today, even getting frequent use during </span><span class="c11 c1">Heaven Burns Red</span><span class="c1">&#39;s development.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span class="c3 c1"><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Later detailed in </span><span class="c11 c1">Satsubatsu Radio</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(which he often presented alongside his university friend and band buddy Nakagawa) Maeda was an untrained musician, so his composition style was one of trial and error. He threw random ideas at the computer and saved whatever sounded good for later.<br>He likened his approach to music-making to a school kid learning to program in BASIC.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">That band he was in with Nakagawa, named </span><span class="c11 c1">KIMELLA</span><span class="c1">, was one of two bands Maeda was in during his university days. The other was named </span><span class="c11 c1">Sailing Ships</span><span class="c1">, formed with a fellow psychology student named Yoshida.<br>Songs from both of these bands were eventually played on Maeda&#39;s radio show, </span><span class="c11 c1">Satsubatsu Radio</span><span class="c1">, so if you&#39;d like, </span><span class="c20 c1"><a class="c31" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj4D08OfthH_UW21v2uW7_gywRtBtyOdM" target="_blank">you can go and listen to them</a></span><span class="c3 c1">. They&#39;ll grow on you.</span></p><p class="c4 c18"><span class="c3 c1"></span><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Maeda got his industry start at a small company named </span><span class="c1">ScooP</span><span class="c1">, where he learned the tools of the trade by helping out on </span><span class="c11 c1">Ojou-sama o Nerae!!</span><span class="c1">, a pretty bad H-scene-hunting game that I reviewed for </span><span class="c11 c1">C-pia!

He was, like Maeda, one of the writers who applied to Tactics during the </span><span class="c11 c1">Dousei</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;advertising... however, unlike Maeda, he didn&#39;t get the job. See, they had already hired Maeda by the time the advert Hisaya saw was published.<br>But Maeda wanted extra writers on the team, so the Nexton staff asked Hisaya to come in to see how things worked, one thing led to another, and Hisaya was hired as a part-timer. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup><span class="c1"><br>This awkward part-timer had no knowledge of writing, didn&#39;t know how to use a computer, and was basically taught everything by Maeda. After </span><span class="c11 c1">MOON.</span><span class="c1">, Hisaya became a full-time employee and work on </span><span class="c11 c1">ONE</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;began.<br>There, Maeda said the goal was to make a story that looks accessible but is deeper than you&#39;d think, so Hisaya worked with the aim of creating characters who unravel from a generic initial appearance.<br>Aside from that, the two didn&#39;t coordinate very much. They were two individual writers working on the same project.</span></p><p class="c4 c18"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">I think </span><span class="c11 c1">Kanon</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is where you best see the differences between the two. Hisaya&#39;s stories have these very empathetic characters that try to hold onto their image until they break and you get the big cry scene. Maeda&#39;s characters don&#39;t hold their image; they slowly lose layers and layers of themselves while you watch it unfold.<br>Hisaya is moe; Maeda is psychology. By depending on one another, they became Key, but if you split them apart... it&#39;s as if they both suddenly felt the need to compensate for no longer having one another. It really shows in their next immediate works, Hisaya with </span><span class="c11 c1">Sola</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and Maeda up through </span><span class="c11 c1">CLANNAD</span><span class="c1">. </span><span class="c11 c1">Sola</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;digs into Maeda&#39;s style of setting, while </span><span class="c11 c1">AIR</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c11 c1">CLANNAD</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;are filled with girls defined by quirky moe habits.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Of course, their manner of making people cry is different. Hisaya&#39;s style relies on plenty of build-up, whereas Maeda just plays a sad song while a sad thing is happening. In his own words: Maeda&#39;s way of making people cry is like a blunt object. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt7" id="cmnt_ref7">[g]</a></sup><br><span class="c1">I, personally, would say that </span><span class="c11 c1">AIR</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c11 c1">CLANNAD</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;are two of the few works where this isn&#39;t true; foreshadowing is integral to the story&#39;s ultimate emotional beats.<br>But both he and Hisaya soon returned to their original styles for the most part.</span></p><p class="c4 c18"><span class="c27 c1 c12"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Their workflow was quite different too. Hisaya would have an idea in mind then work until it was done, where the artists followed his vision. Maeda would work piecemeal, relying on the artists to fill in the gaps in his vision so he can tell what needs fixing. He&#39;s a &quot;try and try again&quot; kind of creator.<br>For this reason, Maeda always struggled to see his visual novels as </span><span class="c1 c7">his</span><span class="c1">. Whenever the company launched a new game, he wouldn&#39;t go to the store to see people buying it... but he would refresh web pages to see what people were saying about </span><span class="c1 c7">his</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;writing specifically. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt8" id="cmnt_ref8">[h]</a></sup><span class="c1"><br><br>Even when he was leading a project, like with </span><span class="c11 c1">MOON.</span><span class="c3 c1">, it was just a project he participated in.

So when the game launched and the first comment submitted to the official site was by a user claiming to have cried during Makoto&#39;s route, Maeda began to feel that he might be able to do what Hisaya does after all.<br>In the audio commentary for Kyoto Animation&#39;s </span><span class="c11 c1">Kanon</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;adaptation, Maeda goes on to praise the route, and says he&#39;ll likely never surpass its quality.</span></p><p class="c4 c18"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Even so, he recalls reading </span><span class="c11 c1">Bugbug</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;magazine and seeing that Hisaya was far more popular with readers... but that makes sense; after all, Hisaya is the man who invented Nakige! </span><sup><a href="#cmnt7" id="cmnt_ref7">[g]</a></sup><span class="c1"><br>...or so, that&#39;s how Maeda feels, but Hisaya views his work as iterative. </span><span class="c11 c1">Kanon</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was a continuation of </span><span class="c11 c1">ONE</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c11 c1">ONE</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was an answer to </span><span class="c11 c1">MOON.</span><span class="c1">, and </span><span class="c11 c1">MOON.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was&mdash;prior to Hisaya joining the team&mdash;titled </span><span class="c11 c1">Tears.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(&#28057;&#12290;). </span><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup><span class="c3 c1"><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">So at the end of the game&#39;s development, the writers came to an ultimatum: one would leave.<br>Maeda was thinking about quitting so that he wouldn&#39;t be stuck under Hisaya&#39;s shadow, but Hisaya wanted to leave as well.<br>The rest of the staff were put in charge of deciding who would stay and who would leave, and Maeda won out.

So he worked for a year at Tactics, and for a further 10 months on </span><span class="c11 c1">Kanon</span><span class="c1">, all with very few breaks.

His big projects were all either complete or at a point in production where he couldn&#39;t help out, so he had a bit of free time. With this free time, he drove himself crazy. He couldn&#39;t just stare at his phone all day, distracted, like ordinary people could.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1"><br>A man from the welfare centre, focused on mental health, told Maeda that he could drop in and chat whenever, but Maeda didn&#39;t want to be a bother, so he declined.<br>But one of the man&#39;s suggestions somehow made it through Maeda&#39;s barrier of rejections: &quot;If you have so much free time, why not write a novel?&quot; It was an innocent question that only someone who doesn&#39;t know Maeda could suggest, and maybe that&#39;s why it worked.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1"><br>Maeda would, for the first time in his career, create something all by himself.<br>For the first time, he put aside his responsibility of continuing the legacy of &#39;nakige&#39; and wrote whatever he wanted.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">It was a depressing story, darker than even the company&#39;s president expected, but therein lay the honesty; it was a work he could be proud of.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">What Maeda wrote was a novel about the unfair world he&#39;d been born into.</span><span class="c1 c7"><br></span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c24 c39 c45">&quot;I never asked to be born into this world, get it?&quot;<br>&nbsp;&quot;Eh...?&quot;<br><br>A weak voice escaped my lips, so quiet, it could be lost to the wind before ever reaching her.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m saying I didn&#39;t ask to be born here.&quot;<br>&nbsp;She took one step forward, looking ready for a fight.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m just a victim of my parents&#39; selfish desire to have children. Honestly, I do have the right to make them sad. They brought me into this world; I didn&#39;t want that. And I know there&#39;ll be more people sad about it than just those two - Yeah, that sucks, but they can complain to my parents. They gave birth to me without telling me a thing, so it&#39;s what they deserve.&quot;<br></span></p><p class="c4 c18"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">A young adult named Tokitsubaki has taken over for her grandfather in monitoring a famous suicide spot. It&#39;s this youth&#39;s job to convince people not to give up on life.<br>As it so happens, a woman looking to jump from the cliff turns up, and the two have a confrontation. She claims that she wants to see &#39;outside the world&#39;, a place one arrives at upon death.</span></p><p class="c4 c18"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">This throwaway fantasy blends with some comedic narration in between the initial drama, so it at first appears to be the usual Maeda storytelling affair, albeit with an immediately darker subject matter than usual.</span></p><p class="c4 c18"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c24 c39">&quot;I&#39;m not one of you ordinary people. Everything in life is a pain or it&#39;s too much effort, and there&#39;s no fun or happiness here. I&#39;m a real sad person.&quot;<br><br>&nbsp;What&#39;s wrong with this woman? Just lay down in bed and look at your phone and the days will pass themselves by.</span></p><p class="c4 c18"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">In case it&#39;s not already obvious, the lady looking to kill herself is a representation of Maeda.<br>She visits her parents maybe once a year.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">She drives herself mad whenever she isn&#39;t distracted by writing music, which is in itself a draining process.<br>She looks down on pop music for being easy, commercialized slop, but it&#39;s how she makes a living, and making a living is what matters.<br>She doesn&#39;t like to rely on others because she doesn&#39;t want to be a bother, plus, she values herself much lower than the people around her.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">She sees herself as not being one of the &quot;ordinary people&quot; and she can&#39;t get by without a drink.<br>She has social media brain rot, feels she&#39;s incapable of love, and is at the age where her body is all aches and pains.<br>Also, she&#39;s weirded out by mundane technologies like umbrellas or train handles. I get that. Don&#39;t look at someone driving in a car for too long; the reality of how odd it is to see a person sat in a stationary box pulled along by four spinning wheels will begin to set in.</span></p><p class="c4 c18"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Anyway! The lady&#39;s pen name is Jyuuroumaru. She&#39;s a composer.<br>She&#39;s her own character of course, not a lazy stand-in for the author, but it&#39;s crystal clear who the author behind her is.</span></p><p class="c4 c18"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">In truth, there&#39;s no fantasy to the tale, just belief. &#39;Wanting to die&#39; sounds like a bad thing, so Jyuuroumaru is instead focused on the next thing. There&#39;s not much hope for this world, but maybe the next world is better, and maybe dying will get her there.<br>Maybe that world will be fun, or maybe she&#39;ll be different, or... basically anything other than reality.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Like the dolphins in an aquarium, some accept life and coast by, but some of them must feel sad. If they died, maybe they&#39;d be reincarnated as one of the people smiling beyond the confines of their glass cage.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1"><br>It&#39;s a reincarnation theory, and in that endless cycle of life, some are born on the outside and are blessed with happiness, while others get trapped in an unfair world.<br>Having known someone who went through a very long depression period, she too believed a similar thing: that it was okay to have lived such a sad life because the more important life she has in some greater world beyond our own is yet to be lived.<br>A lot of the novel is like that; I recognize her thoughts and actions as something from my own life experience. The target audience of the work is firmly &quot;people like Maeda&quot;, but as someone who isn&#39;t like Maeda, the book is incredible at making me recognize and think about the depression of others in my life.</span></p><p class="c4 c18"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">Maybe it&#39;s because of the people I&#39;ve known, or maybe it&#39;s because of how close she is to Maeda, but Jyuuroumaru is a very well-realized character. That&#39;s the essence of the work.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c1">The contrast between a happy person working a mundane job and a depressed person working alongside celebrities becomes an obvious point of attention, and this spirals into a whole heap of conversations about topics that pertain to the &#39;perpetually depressed musician&#39; lifestyle, during which, the depressed girl is prone to long rants about the world.</span></p><p class="c4 c18"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c44"><span class="c24">&nbsp;&quot;</span><span class="c39 c28 c47">On Saturdays and Sundays, people usually go see a movie or spend time with friends, go on dates or get some family time. That&#39;s what normal is, right?<br>&nbsp;But I&#39;m not normal, so life&#39;s full of blank hours with nothing to do. I sit and wait for Monday to come - when the world will begin to move again - while endlessly enduring those blank hours as they come.<br>&nbsp;Those other guys probably don&#39;t live just to do their job; they&#39;ve got friends, partners, families, meaningful private lives and stuff. So of course they enjoy the weekend, but me? I don&#39;t have that. All I have is work.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4 c18"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">It&#39;s a slow-paced, low-stakes story full of long protracted rambling from a depressed woman in mundane scenarios, and so... you can really tell it&#39;s not meant to be a commercial product like Maeda&#39;s Key works.<br>It is, in essence, another </span><span class="c11 c1">AIR</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c11 c1">Tomoyo After</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c11 c1">Love Song</span><span class="c1">, but even the more honest VNs he worked on had some spice or drama to keep them entertaining to general audiences. </span><span class="c11 c1">Nekogarizoku no Osa</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;has none of that.<br>It&#39;s a simple story, the entertainment value of which depends wholly on whether you find Jyuuroumaru interesting or not. Does the gap between her stunted maturity and ample life experience keep you turning the pages?<br>The only fallback is Maeda&#39;s usual comedic style: a character says something silly and another points out how silly it is. Other than that, it&#39;s a heartfelt piece.</span></p><p class="c4 c18"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c28 c47">&quot;I&#39;d like to try loving someone.
